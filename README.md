Creating a Cylinder with Java Processing

This repository contains a Java Processing project that demonstrates the creation of a cylinder using the Processing library. The cylinder is rendered in a 3D environment and can rotate automatically or using the mouse.

## Preview

Here's a preview of the generated cylinder rotating automatically:

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies:

- [Processing](https://processing.org/): A flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Processing-Cylinder.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or text editor.

3. Make sure you have the Processing library set up in your IDE.

4. Build and run the project.

## Usage

After running the project, you will see a window displaying the rotating cylinder. Click to use your mouse to rotate the cylinder in the 3D space. 

The cylinder consists of a top circle, a cylindrical body, and a bottom circle.

## Customization

You can modify the following variables in the `Main` class to customize the cylinder:

- `numOfFaces`: Determines the number of faces or segments of the cylinder. Increasing this value will result in a smoother cylinder.
- `h`: Specifies the height of the cylinder.
- `r`: Sets the radius of the cylinder.

Feel free to experiment with different values and modify the code to create variations of the cylinder.
